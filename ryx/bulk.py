"""
Ryx ORM — Bulk Operations

bulk_create : INSERT many rows in a single SQL statement (or batched).
bulk_update : UPDATE many rows using a CASE expression.
bulk_delete : DELETE rows by PK list.

These bypass per-instance hooks and validation by default (for performance).
Pass validate=True to run full_clean() on each instance before inserting.

Usage:
  posts = [Post(title=f"Post {i}") for i in range(1000)]
  await bulk_create(Post, posts, batch_size=500)

  await bulk_update(Post, posts, fields=["views", "active"])

Design notes:
  - bulk_create uses a single multi-row INSERT: INSERT INTO t (a,b) VALUES (?,?),(?,?)
    which is much faster than N individual INSERTs.
  - We batch by batch_size to avoid hitting DB parameter limits (SQLite: 999,
    Postgres: 65535, MySQL: 65535).
  - bulk_update emits one UPDATE per batch using a VALUES list + JOIN trick on
    Postgres/MySQL, or a CASE WHEN expression on SQLite.

    Significantly faster than calling ``instance.save()`` in a loop because
    it uses a single multi-row ``INSERT INTO t (...) VALUES (...),(...)``
    per batch.

    Args:
        model:            The Model class.
        instances:        Sequence of unsaved model instances.
        batch_size:       Number of rows per INSERT statement. Default: 500.
                          Postgres supports up to ~65k params; SQLite max is 999
                          total params, so keep batch_size low for wide tables.
        validate:         If True, runs ``full_clean()`` on each instance before
                          inserting. Slows things down but catches bad data early.
        ignore_conflicts: If True, add ``ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`` (Postgres) or
                          ``INSERT IGNORE`` (MySQL). No-op on SQLite (uses OR IGNORE).

    Returns:
        The same list of instances (pks may not be set — depends on the DB
        driver's ability to return them from a multi-row INSERT).

    Signals:
        Does NOT fire pre_save / post_save to keep bulk operations fast.
        Connect to ``pre_bulk_create`` / ``post_bulk_create`` if needed.
